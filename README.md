There have been two bottlen necks stucking companies shift to data-driven paradigam. First, there is no tool for everyone in a company who wants quickly get answers by themselves. Excel is familiar to almost everyone, but the data size limit, data accessibility, organization of transformations, and collaboration capability are not good enough. Second, the data team is exhausted by the shit mountain of the SQL and other data transformation codes. Besides, the unclear requirements in emails, talking, and documents from business teams also are dragging down the data team.

And our tool organizes the data transformations in a clear and self-expressed way. Moreover, our product can automatically translate the data transformations to SQL compatible with many databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
